      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:
Main Findings [Here you will describe the results and include important visualizations from your project.</description>

      <description>Model Results 
For more details on the specification of our model, see the Data &amp;amp; Methods tab.

Measures of Model Fit We assessed the specification of our model using a posterior predictive check, which is common in Bayesian estimation. The posterior predictive check compares the distribution of predicted response times for each MCMC draw (I think this needs a very brief elaboration â€“ people may not know what is being drawn exactly) to the actual distribution of response times in the data.</description>

      <description>COVID-19 COVID-19 has affected all parts of life and we are interested in how it has impacted Emergency Medical Services in Charlottesville and the larger Albermarle County. Counterintuitively, we can observe that there is a significant drop off in call volume to emergency medical services. This may be caused by people staying at home more and thus there being less emergency incidents.</description>
