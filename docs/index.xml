      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:
Main Findings [Here you will describe the results and include important visualizations from your project.</description>

      <description>Model Results 
For more details on the specification of our model, see the Data &amp;amp; Methods tab.

Measures of Model Fit We assessed the specification of our model using a posterior predictive check, which is common in Bayesian estimation. The posterior predictive check compares the distribution of predicted response times for each MCMC draw (I think this needs a very brief elaboration – people may not know what is being drawn exactly) to the actual distribution of response times in the data.</description>

      <description>h3, h4 { text-align: center }  Data Sources This project relied primarily on a dataset of EMS incidents in Charlottesville City and Albemarle County that spanned from the December 2016 to June 2020. These data consisted of numerous variables regularly recorded by EMS providers when responding to an incident. The variables available can be broken down into three rough categories:
 Operations  Incident date and time Unit and crew dispatched Scene location and type Response time to incident Hospital patient was delivered to  Medical  Patient symptoms (based on provider&#39;s impression and/or patient&#39;s reported complaints) Vital signs (temperature, pulse, etc.</description>

      <description>h3, h4 { text-align: center }  The Impact of COVID-19 on the Equitable Delivery of Emergency Medical Services 
Background In recent years, public health efforts have begun to focus increasingly on the social determinants of health as a means of understanding the prevailing health inequalities in the United States and across the world. While many of these determinants very clearly relate to population health (access to health care resources, for instance), others are more subtle in their health impacts, like residential segregation, education, and cultural values1.</description>

      <description>COVID-19 COVID-19 has affected all parts of life and we are interested in how it has impacted Emergency Medical Services in Charlottesville and the larger Albermarle County. Counterintuitively, we can observe that there is a significant drop off in call volume to emergency medical services. This may be caused by people staying at home more and thus there being less emergency incidents.</description>
