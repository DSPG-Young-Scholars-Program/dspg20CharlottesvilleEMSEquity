### UVA Data Science for the Public Good Program {style=text-align:center}

<div class = "justify">
[The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/social-decision-analytics/dspg-program) is a summer immersive program held at the [Biocomplexity Instituteâ€™s Social and Decision Analytics division (SDAD)](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/social-decision-analytics). In its seventh year, the program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG young scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy. For more information on program highlights, how to apply, and our annual symposium, please visit the official [Biocomplexity DSPG website]((https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/social-decision-analytics/dspg-program)).

### The Impact of COVID-19 on the Equitable Delivery of Emergency Medical Services {style=text-align:center}

<br>

#### Project Summary

<div class = "justify">
The Charlottesville Fire Department, the Albemarle County Department of Fire and Rescue and the University of Virginia are working together to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting their community, with particular emphasis on the delivery of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The DSPG and SDAD team has worked to evaluate how EMS operations have changed when compared to operations prior to the epidemic and analyzed variation in service delivery for historically underserved communities in the Charlottesville and Albemarle area.
